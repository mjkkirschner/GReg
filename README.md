# Log Files
The package manager `./start-server` script uses [foreverjs](https://github.com/foreverjs/forever). It is configured to write three log files to `/logs`, `ERR`,`OUT`, and `LOG`. These log files are rotated weekly using [logrotate](http://www.linuxcommand.org/man_pages/logrotate8.html). The logrotate configuration file, and a cron job for running logrotate can be found in `/logrotate`.
